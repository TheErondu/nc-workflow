Its Half Year but We Got This!
Have you noticed that the News Central brand is becoming stronger and more noticeable? Also, the office environment is getting more fast-paced especially as our programs are getting better and watched more each day. Therefore, the pressure to improve, innovate and exceed expectations is mounting each day. In a business environment that keeps changing every day we cannot afford to rest on our oars now! The results of the monthly MPS cable TV Audience rating is out for May 2021 and we have our work cut out for us.
